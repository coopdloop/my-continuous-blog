# Introduction

Welcome to my **_new blog_** about my life and my passion for my career! Here, I will share my learning journey as I continue down my path in security and app development.

## What I've Accomplished

1. **Full Stack Web Development**: I've embarked on a long journey to understand the fundamentals of applications and how to make them more secure. As a member of Gen Z, I recognize the significant evolution in web development and seek to bridge the gap between its origins and its current state. For further insights, I highly recommend watching Primeagen's video on the topic:

- **Full Pipeline CI/CD**: I've harnessed the power of [Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to establish a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline for this blog. This setup will also be employed to deploy my other applications. Feel free to explore the source code of this blog project to gain a deeper understanding of how actions facilitate CI/CD. In this context, the CD process involves deploying to [AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/), while the CI process encompasses building and testing the Astro application, ensuring its readiness for production.

- **Application Security**: A significant focus of this blog will be on bridging the gap between application security and development. By adopting secure development practices, we can construct more robust and resilient applications. I'll be sharing my journey in secure application development, detailing each step and the rationale behind my extensive research. Additionally, I'll provide insights into my [eWPTx](https://www.elearnsecurity.com/certification/ewptx/) journey and how to apply these skills to enhance the security of your applications.
